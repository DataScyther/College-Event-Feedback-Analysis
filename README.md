Data Science & Analytics Task 3
By Future Interns

**College Event Feedback Analysis â€“ Internship Project**

Utilize data science to enhance campus life! Learn how to transform student feedback into actionable insights using practical tools such as Google Colab, pandas, and TextBlobâ€”no coding background is required.

**Project Overview**
College events, including technology festivals, workshops, and cultural activities, collect feedback. However, are we utilizing it effectively?

In this project, interns will analyze text and rating-based feedback submitted by students after attending campus events. You will collaborate with simulated or actual Google Forms data (CSV) and employ fundamental Natural Language Processing (NLP) to comprehend satisfaction levels and identify areas for improvement.

**What I Did**
âœ… Clean and prepare feedback data (from a Google Form export)
âœ… Analyze ratings (1â€“5 scale) to identify patterns of satisfaction
âœ… Utilize NLP tools to score sentiment in comments (positive/neutral/negative)
âœ… Visualize trends with visually appealing charts and graphs
âœ… Suggest improvements for future events

**Skills I Gained**
Data cleaning and preparation using pandas
Sentiment analysis utilizing TextBlob or VADER
Creating bar charts, pie charts, and word clouds for reports
Interpreting survey data to facilitate informed decision-making
Collaborating in Google Colab (no software installation required)

**Tools & Libraries**
**Tool**	**Purpose**
Google Colab	Online coding (no setup required)
pandas	Data manipulation
seaborn/matplotlib	Visualization
TextBlob / VADER	Sentiment analysis (NLP)

**Sample Dataset (CSV format)**
Utilize any of the following methods or simulate your own:

ðŸ”— Student Feedback Survey Responses
ðŸ”— Student Satisfaction Survey
ðŸ“„ Alternatively, collect data from a real Google Form:
Request students to rate and provide feedback after an event.
Export the responses as CSV format.
You are now prepared to analyze the data!

ðŸ“Š Example Insights You Can Obtain
Top 3 events with the highest satisfaction ratings
Most prevalent complaints from comments (via word cloud visualization)
Correlation between ratings and event type (workshop vs seminar)
Which departments hosted the most-liked events
ðŸŽ¥ YouTube Tutorials for Beginners (for Reference)
ðŸ“Œ Google Colab for Beginners â€“ FreeCodeCamp
ðŸ“Œ Sentiment Analysis in Python â€“ TextBlob
